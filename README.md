I'm a master student of [MAC Laboratory](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/) at Xiamen University(XMU). I received the B.E. degree from Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT) in 2024. 
My research interests are in computer vision and machine learning, with a particular focus on image generation and video generation.
